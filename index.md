## Vision
Artificial Intelligence shows significant promise when applied to domains like health and sustainability. Specifically, machine learning and its applications in these domains have been well researched and have even started deployment. However, there are risks and challenges that need to be addressed in these high-stakes domains before practitioners and ML scientists can trust and scale these solutions to public use, while finding new avenues to research.

### Agenda

Through this seminar series, we will host talks from various research groups both within NYU and external collaborators in the NYC area who actively work on applying AI for Health and Sustainability. We aim to utilize the 1 hour session to facilitate interaction to gather early feedback and collaboration between researchers and practitioners in ongoing projects. The topics that would interest this group include, but are not limited to, how advances in AI have transformed applications in: 
* Medical research (computer vision in radiology, pathology, EHR and human vision tools)
* Bioinformatics (genomics, structural and molecular interaction networks)
* Climate change research (atmospheric modeling, pollution, rainfall)
* Global health (disease surveillance and public health risk monitoring)
* Sustainability and socio-economic development (traffic, news and satellite based inference)

|1| Oct 18 | Ananth Balashankar | **Identifying Predictive Causal Graphs from News for Health and Economic Monitoring** : We propose a new framework to uncover the relationship between news events and real world phenomena. We present Predictive Causal  Graphs (PCG) which detects latent relationships between events mentioned in news streams. This graph is constructed by measuring how the occurrence of a word in the news influences the occurrence of another (set of) word(s) in the future. We use PCGs to enrich disease surveillance systems using measures of social and environmental factors which are known to influence the spread of a disease with sparse ground truth signals. Specifically, we model the epidemiological transmission of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) disease during the outbreak that occurred from 2013 to 2018 in the Arabian peninsula. We also capture interpretable time-sensitive factors which illustrate the importance of using real time news stream to model the evolution of a disease such as MERS and facilitate early and effective policy interventions. Additionally, we extend PCG to identify factors in the news to reliably predict time series of 10 stock prices over longer time windows (3 years) by allowing time-varying factors. In both these cases, PCG augments domain specific models to achieve better predictive performance. | [paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3332498) |
| 2. | Oct 25 | Daniel Neill | This talk will describe three distinct, emerging areas in which machine learning algorithms have great potential to assist public health practitioners in monitoring and improving population health. First, we describe new approaches for targeting health interventions (such as naloxone distribution and medication-assisted treatment) to address the opioid crisis. Our methods provide situational awareness of emerging patterns of overdoses, opioid use disorder, and risk behaviors at the geographic, subpopulation, and individual levels. Second, we describe a new event detection approach, the multidimensional semantic scan, that provides public health practitioners with a "safety net" to detect newly emerging disease outbreaks and other previously unknown but potentially relevant patterns, using chief complaint data from hospital emergency departments. Finally, we briefly describe our work in discovering heterogeneity in treatment effects, and how we will use these approaches to understand the effects of adverse environmental exposures (including poor housing conditions and over-policing of minority neighborhoods) on the impacted individuals' physical and mental health. Together, these methods will provide public health agencies with a suite of tools and methods to improve the overall quality of population health and reduce health disparities.  |   |
| 3. | Nov 1 | Krzysztof. J. Geras | **Towards solving breast cancer screening diagnosis with deep learning**: Although deep learning has made a stunning progress in the last few years, both in terms of engineering and theory, its real-life applications remain rather limited. One of the fields that has been anticipated to be revolutionized by deep learning for some time, yet proved to be much harder that many expected, is medical diagnosis. In this talk I will shed some light on my 3-year long journey in developing deep learning methods for medical imaging, in particular, for breast cancer screening. I will explain how we created a deep learning model that can perform a diagnosis with an accuracy comparable to experienced radiologists. To achieve this goal we needed a lot of perseverance, novel neural network architectures and training methods specific to medical imaging. I will also discuss the limitations of our work and what can likely be achieved in the next few years. |  |
| 4. | Nov 8 | Vincent Major | **Predicting End-Of-Life in the Hospital: Preliminary Results and Challenges:** Advanced care planning (ACP) conversations are an essential communication tool for aligning patient wishes with their end-of-life care. However, identification of an appropriate time, in practice, to initiate these conversations is challenging. Quantitative tools that identify patients at risk can prompt physicians to start an ACP conversation and consider initiating other supportive care interventions that are currently heterogeneously applied in practice. Patients at risk of dying are frequently admitted to the hospital due to an exacerbation of symptoms or deterioration. However, these patients are often discharged without any supportive care intervention. Automatic identification of a population at risk could prompt the primary care team to conduct an ACP conversation as early as possible within the hospitalization. The patient and care team are expected to benefit from alignment of patient goals with clinical approach and, in conjunction, hospital-wide consistency of care may improve. Prior supportive care works have either failed to translate predictive models into prospective use or have not shown consistent provider adherence or improvement in patient outcomes. We have developed predictive models that have operated prospectively at NYU Langone Health since October 2018. In this time we have observed good adherence to ACP recommendations and trends of improving patient outcomes. We are planning a clinical evaluation study but are faced with several challenges including defining a meaningful improvement, selecting a comparison group, controlling for parallel institutional efforts, and incorporating iterative upgrades to the system. | TBD |
| 5. | Nov 11 | Colleen Josephson | **Accelerating Data-Driven Agriculture with Wireless Sensing** Agriculture is the single largest pressure on the world’s sources of fresh water— 69% of the global fresh water supply is used for farming. Yet despite decades of research confirming the benefits, soil moisture sensors are used on less than 10% of US farms because of the high cost and the difficulty of deploying and maintaining these sensors.  We designed a soil moisture sensing system that uses a hybrid approach of pairing completely wireless backscatter tags with a mobile reader. These low-cost, low-maintenance backscatter tags have a projected battery lifetime of up to 15 years on 4×AA batteries, and can operate at depths up to 75cm. We achieve an average accuracy that is comparable to state-of-the-art commercial soil sensors, at an order of magnitude lower cost. | TBD |
| 6. | Nov 15 | Mukund Sudarshan | **Model-Agnostic Feature Selection with Additional Mutual Information**: Answering questions about data can require understanding what parts of an input X influence the response Y. Finding such an understanding can be built by testing relationships between variables through a machine learning model. For example, conditional randomization tests help determine whether a variable relates to the response given the rest of the variables. However, randomization tests require users to specify test statistics. We formalize a class of proper test statistics that are guaranteed to select a feature when it provides information about the response even when the rest of the features are known. We show that f-divergences provide a broad class of proper test statistics. In the class of f-divergences, the KL-divergence yields an easy-to-compute proper test statistic that relates to the AMI. Questions of feature importance can be asked at the level of an individual sample.  We show that estimators from the same AMI test can also be used to find important features in a particular instance. We provide an example to show that perfect predictive models are insufficient for instance-wise feature selection. We evaluate our method on several simulation experiments, on a genomic dataset, a clinical dataset for hospital readmission, and on a subset of classes in ImageNet. Our method outperforms several baselines in various simulated datasets, is able to identify biologically significant genes, can select the most important predictors of a hospital readmission event, and is able to identify distinguishing features in an image-classification task. | TBD |
